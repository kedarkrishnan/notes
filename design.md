#Design Principles
- High Cohesion and Low Coupling
- YAGNI - You ain't going to need it 
- DRY - Do not repeat yourself (code and effort)
- Single Responsibility Principle
	- Short methods
	- SLAP - Single level of Absraction
	- Compose Method Pattern
- Open-Close principle (OCP)
	 - Abstraction and polymorphism
- Liskov's substitution principle
	- Inheritance should be used only for substitutability
		- If an Object of B should be used **anywhere** an object of A is used then use inheritance
		- If an Object of B should be **use** an object of A, then use composition / delegation		
	- User of the base class should be able to use an instance of the derived class without knowing the difference
		- Services of the derived class should require no more and promise no less than the corresponding services of the base class
			- public vs protected in base vs derived
			- derived function can't throw a new checked exception not thrown by the base class (unless the new exception extends the old one...) 
			- collection of derived does not extend from collection of base
	- Use composition or delegation instead of inheritance unless you want substitutability
		- In Java this may violate DRY , OCP		
		- Using Groovy @Delegate does not viloate DRY, OCP as its compile time meta programming		
- Dependency inversion principle - Decouple
	- Class should not depend on another class, they have to depend on an abstraction (interface)
- Interface segregation principle - Keep interfaces Cohesive
	- Make the interfaces narrow focused and cohesive
